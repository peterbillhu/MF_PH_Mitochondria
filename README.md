# Morphological multiparameter filtration and persistent homology in mitochondrial image analysis

Implementation of the paper "Morphological multiparameter filtration and persistent homology in mitochondrial image analysis" by Yu-Min Chung, Chuan-Shen Hu, Emily Sun, Henry C. Tseng

## Image Data
There are a total of 15 grayscale images in the folder "data," encoded in the Portable Network Graphics (PNG) format, which can be freely accessed. Images classified as WT and KO are stored in the repository in their respective folders ("data/WT" and "data/KO"). Please contact the authors if further technical support is needed.

## Code Description
The code for computing the connectivity index of an input image with threshold T. 


The code for computing the normalized Betti number curve of a given image, based on the opening operations.


The code for computing the size distribution of Betti numbers of a given image and the threshold.
